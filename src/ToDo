Ideas/Tricks

getStatement
  ends with ; or {


what to care about:
types
methods?
	-might not care?
	-if we have the class, then checking methods might not matter? 
	-need to be distinguished from functions
global functions
	-like types

types declared and types used


line -> statement -> types of statement
						- type declaration
						- function declaration
						- 


either ends with ; or recurses with {} and don't care about ,

check for type declaration, check for type usage.


Todo:
- identify type declarations 
- identify function/method declarations
- build database of types, declarations for each file

build object for each statement(why?) eg:
    class SimpleDataPane : public DataPane , public SimplePaneChannelAssoc < SimpleDataPane > {

    declaration statement of type class


Enums:
- each constant in enum type should be a type/dependency
- deal with "enum class"

Functions/Methods:
- starts with a type

goal is to figure out what types, globals are consumed


recognise function declaration:
type word();
type word(type, ...);
